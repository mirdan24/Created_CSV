Task 2:
We download data from the test.csv file. Then we check if the values from the student_id and class_id fields are repeated at the same time. If this happens, the line will be deleted. The corrected file is saved as edit_test.csv.

Task 3:
Initially, data is downloaded from the edit_test.csv and class.csv files. Then we create a database, which presents, among others the number of tests written in a given class.

Task 4:
We download data from edit_test.csv and class.csv files. Then the average score for the given class and the possible range of the sum of teaching hours are calculated.
